# Store to learn Nuxt 3

## Introduction

This project was created to improve my own knowledge about Nuxt technology. Feel free to fork, modify, start an issue and or only 
download this repo and run it on your local environment to see how it's working.

## The journey up to this point

At this point in the project timeline I'm capable to understand:
- How to install the base project;
- How to create new pages and apply routes to navigate them;
- How to create new pages that will receive and render params values;
- How to create layouts to reusing code;
- How to install third libraries like Tailwind CSS using Nuxt modules;
- How to apply styles to the project using the tailwind.css default file; 
- How to hydrate variables with API requests (fetchData(uri)) and much more...

## Setup

Locally I like to use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage my Node JS setup. During this project development I used:

```bash
Node: v16.20.1
```

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# yarn
yarn dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# yarn
yarn build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# yarn
yarn preview
```
